I am a Data Analyst with 5 years of experience. I have worked on data analytic projects with different industries(retail, consulting firms, fintech) providing metrics and reporting capabilities from c level management all the way to end users and clients. 

Some of the systems and tools I have worked with had business objectives like resource planning, delivery capacity and standard operation metrics for daily activities. 

I have mainly used SQL and [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/magdalena.martinez/vizzes) for these projects but also have R and Python experience for predictive analysis. I recently graduated as a Master of Science in Business Analytics from University of Washington(Go Dawgs!).

Big fan of reading, running, cooking, lakes and spending time with my loved ones.
